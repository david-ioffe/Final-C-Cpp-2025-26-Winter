Exam Simulator in GitHub instead of in Moodle Exam. 
The idea is to move all tests from the current workplace - Moodle Exam into GitHub/Github-Codespaces. 

The Professor can open a repo and write the exam, tests and submition. 
Students will take the exam in GitHub-Codespaces. 

This will free resources from moodle - and let students take the exam without fear of moodle shutting down mid exam.
